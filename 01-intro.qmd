-   How do you **access** the shell?
-   How do you **use** the shell?

## How to access the shell

You access the shell using the "terminal". The terminal is a window into which we will type commands in. The terminal is already available on Mac and Linux. For windows you must download a separate program.

## Starting with the shell

We will spend most of our time learning about the basics of the shell by manipulating some experimental data from a hearing test.

### Making a new directory

First, we're going to create a new **directory** to work in using the command `mkdir` which stands for "**m**a**k**e **dir**ectory".

The word "directory" a location for storing files on a computer and it is synonym to "folder".

To create the directory, we must type the following command in the terminal and hit return to execute the command.

``` bash
$ mkdir training
```

### Listing and navigating

Now let's see if our new directory was created using the command `ls` that stands for "list" or "listing".

``` bash
$ ls
```

You should see your new directory called "training" in the list displayed in the terminal.

Now we're going to go into that directory using the command `cd` which stands for "**c**hange **d**irectory".

``` bash
$ cd training
```

Now let's look at see what's in here. There should be nothing right now, because we just made it, but let's check using the command `ls` again.

Now we are going to create a text file using the command `touch`

``` bash
$ touch file.txt
```

We can now check with if the file was created using the `ls` command again.

Now we're going to download the data for this tutorial. For this you'll need internet access, because you're going to get it off the web. Enter the command:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/clarajegousse/training-data
```

This command will grab all of the data needed for this workshop from the internet.

Now let's check to see that we got the data.

``` bash
$ ls
```

In there, all mixed up together are files and directories/folders. If we want to know which is which, we can type: `ls -F`

``` bash
$ ls -F
```

Anything with a `/` after it is a directory. Things with a `*` after them are programs. If there's after the name, then it's a file.

You can also use the command `ls -l` to see whether items in a directory are files or directories. `ls -l` gives a lot more information too, such as the size of the file.

``` bash
$ ls -l
```

So, we can see that we have several files, directories and a program. Great!

## **Arguments**

Most commands offer additional arguments that control their exact behavior. For example, `-F` and `-l` are arguments to `ls`. The `ls` program, like many programs, take a lot of arguments. But how do we know what the options are to particular commands? We can consult the manual!

## Manuals

We can consult the manual using the following:

``` bash
$ man ls
```

To exit the manual, hit the `q` key to "**q**uit".

Every single command has its own manual. Earlier, we used the command `cd` and we can also consult the manual for `cd`:

``` bash
$ man cd
```

::: callout-tip
Programs that are run from the command line can be complex. To see an example, open up the manual page for the `find` program. No one can possibly learn all of these arguments, of course. So you will probably find yourself referring back to the manual page frequently.
